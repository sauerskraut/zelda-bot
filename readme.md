# Zelda Bot

## What is this?

This repo aims to be a working interface and neural network agent to play The Legend of Zelda (1987).
The interface is built using [Nintaco](https://nintaco.com/).

## What are the goals?

Eventually hookup a reinforcement learning agent and see how badly it can play Zelda.

## Isn't Zelda too complicated for an RL agent? What is the plan here?

The first goal is to get the agent to figure out how to clear a dungeon. When and if we get to that point, we can see if the overworld is even mildly feasible.

## Does this include the game itself?

**NO!** You have to provide the game in .nes format yourself. I will not provide the .nes file in any way, shape, or form.
